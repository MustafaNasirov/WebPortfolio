# WebPortfolio

Simple & clean portfolio website created to demonstrate the skills I have learnt in the first week of _nology such as HTML & SCSS, responsive design using a mobile-first design, and BEM naming conventions.

The SCSS files are split into a seperate folder where the main 'style.scss' file utilises the styles for the portfolio.

The portfolio will be updated throughout the 12-week _nology course as I improve my skills in web development.
